# Python-Libraries

Python has been built with extraordinary Python libraries for data science that are used by programmers every day in solving problems. Here’s the top Python libraries tutorials for data science:
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib
4) Seaborn 


## NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for numerical computation in Python; it contains a powerful N-dimensional array object. It has around 18,000 comments on GitHub and an active community of 700 contributors. It’s a general-purpose array-processing package that provides high-performance multidimensional objects called arrays and tools for working with them. NumPy also addresses the slowness problem partly by providing these multidimensional arrays as well as providing functions and operators that operate efficiently on these arrays. 

### Features:
* Provides fast, precompiled functions for numerical routines
* Array-oriented computing for better efficiency
* Supports an object-oriented approach
* Compact and faster computations with vectorization
### Applications:
* Extensively used in data analysis 
* Creates powerful N-dimensional array
* Forms the base of other libraries, such as SciPy and scikit-learn
* Replacement of MATLAB when used with SciPy and matplotlib

## Pandas
Pandas (Python data analysis) is a must in the data science life cycle. It is the most popular and widely used Python library for data science, along with NumPy in matplotlib. With around 17,00 comments on GitHub and an active community of 1,200 contributors, it is heavily used for data analysis and cleaning. Pandas provides fast, flexible data structures, such as data frame CDs, which are designed to work with structured data very easily and intuitively. 

### Features:
* Eloquent syntax and rich functionalities that gives you the freedom to deal with missing data
* Enables you to create your own function and run it across a series of data
* High-level abstraction
* Contains high-level data structures and manipulation tools
### Applications: 
* General data wrangling and data cleaning
* ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs for data transformation and data storage, as it has excellent support for loading CSV files into its data frame format
* Used in a variety of academic and commercial areas, including statistics, finance and neuroscience 
* Time-series-specific functionality, such as date range generation, moving window, linear regression and date shifting.

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib has powerful yet beautiful visualizations. It’s a plotting library for Python with around 26,000 comments on GitHub and a very vibrant community of about 700 contributors. Because of the graphs and plots that it produces, it’s extensively used for data visualization. It also provides an object-oriented API, which can be used to embed those plots into applications.
### Features:
* Usable as a MATLAB replacement, with the advantage of being free and open source 
* Supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can use it regardless of which operating system you’re using or which output format you wish to use
* Pandas itself can be used as wrappers around MATLAB API to drive MATLAB like a cleaner
* Low memory consumption and better runtime behavior
### Applications:
* Correlation analysis of variables
* Visualize 95 percent confidence intervals of the models
* Outlier detection using a scatter plot etc.
* Visualize the distribution of data to gain instant insights

## Seaborn
Seaborn is Python’s most commonly used library for statistical data visualisation, used for heatmaps and visualisations that summarise data and depict distributions. It is based on Matplotlib and can be used on both data frames and arrays.
